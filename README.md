# flood_management

Predicting a natural disaster is totally a random event.We can just predict and  say flood is going to happen .That is no way to escape from the disaster .So management of a natural disaster is more important than the prevention itself
People are ready to help during the time of natural disaster but they are not sure about who to help and where to go to help . At the end of the day it s not just about prediction .It s all about physical human help at time of disasters.Our app will organise this so that people get right help at the right time.  

We're coming up with an app that will have 2 parts. 
1)we try to predict when a flood will occur based on  rainfall,dam water level,high tides ,etc which is a classic method 
2) Our focus is to mainly point out the most vulnerable regions before time  that disaster occurs and list out things needed by the people.  If the unthinkable happens and a certain region is hit hard by a natural disaster, we try to reach out to them through their neighbours, that is, since the person affected will most probably be unable to call for help,  the people closest to them(nearby area) who are relatively unaffected by the disaster to inform us of their problems. Based on people s information during the time of disaster and the existing data we can find the things needed by the people and connect them to the people who are ready to help.
