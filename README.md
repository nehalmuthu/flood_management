# flood_management

Predicting a natural disaster is totally a random event.We can just predict and  say flood is going to happen .That is no way going to save lives or properties.So management of a natural disaster is more important than the prevention itself  
We're coming up with an app that will have 2 parts. 
1)we try to predict when a flood will occur based on its  geography ,etc
2) Our focus is to mainly point out the most vulnerable regions rather than predicting when the natural disaster will occur. 
	If the unthinkable happens and a certain region is hit hard by a natural disaster, we try to reach out to them through their neighbours, that is, since the person affected will most probably be unable to call for help, we ask the people closest to them who are relatively unaffected by the disaster to inform us of their problems. We'll connect them to the people who are willing to help through the app. Based on what is important, we'll prioritize certain items so that the people who need help more urgently receive it first.
